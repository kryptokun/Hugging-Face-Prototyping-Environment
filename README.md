# Ai startup project

What do we need

- ability to take input (from web UI or from another API or from file upload)
- ability to choose ai model (from web UI)
- ability to give output (to web UI or as file download or to another API)

## Tasks


Create optional input field for model name(typed out)

1. print the output from the API call to the screen (along with how much time it took and hopefully costs)
2. send a file in pieces to the hugging face API
3. print the output as a file download
4. instead of using hugging face, run a model locally
5. setup AWS sagemaker and move the code there
